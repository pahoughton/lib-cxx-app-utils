Test_g -ss 0 -sd -sl 0

I have discovered another problem with threads on 'skyler'. I get an
Illegal instruction (core dump) when I create threads from a thread.

The pthread_create call will return with no error, but the pthread_t
(used by the thread API) will have an invalid address ( 0x0 | 0x20 | 0x200 )
and the application gets an Illegal Instruction.

This only seems to happen if I create a number of new threads from an
existing thread ( other than the main thread ). I also appears to be
timing sensitive. If I call sleep() in the new thread or between
creation of the new threads, The application runs ok.
