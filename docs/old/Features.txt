General Description:

    LibStlUtils is a collection of generic C++ classes, functions, and
    defines that can be used by any application. 


Common Interface Methods:

    The following methods are available for most classes

    class AClass
    {
    public:

      size_t	getStreamSize( void ) const;
      ostream & write( ostream & dest ) const;
      istream &	read( istream & src );
      
      int	    compare( const AClass & two ) const;
      
      bool	    operator == ( const AClass & two ) const;
      bool	    operator <  ( const AClass & two ) const;

      bool	    good( void ) const;
      const char *  error( void ) const;
      const char *  getClassName( void ) const;
      ostream &	    toStream( ostream & dest = cout ) const;
      ostream &	    dumpInfo( ostream & dest = cerr ) const;

      static const char *   version[];
    };

    int
    compare( const AClass & one, const AClass & two );

    ostream &
    operator << ( ostream & dest, const AClass & obj );


    Descriptions:
    
    getStreamSize
	return the size (in bytes) required to store this object in
	binary form in a stream.

    write
	write this object to the stream in binary form

    read
	read a stream that contains the binary representation of an
	object of this type.

    compare
	return the difference between this object and another of the same
	type.

    toStream
	A method implementation of operator << functionallity.

    dumpInfo
	Dump detailed info about the instance to the stream.
