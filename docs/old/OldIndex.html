    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Bitmask
      <dd>
	This class provides for easy to use high perfomance
	bit manipulations. It can be used to manipulate up to
	32 bits (i.e. a long on most architectures). To work with
	more than 32 bits, see bit_vector in the STL.
	<p>
      <dt>ClassVersion
      <dd>
	Provides information about a class's version that is accessible
	at run time.
	<p>
      <dt>Compress
      <dd>
	Compress and/or decompress a file using the same algorithm as the
	Unix compress utility.
	<p>
      <dt>DateRange
      <dd>
	A DateRange has a start (date/time) plus a duration(end
	date/time).
	<p>
      <dt>DateRangeDaily
      <dd>
	This is a range in time within a signle day that applies to any
	number of days.
	<p>
      <dt>DateRangeWeekly
      <dd>
	This is a range in time within a signle day of the week.
	<p>
      <dt>DateTime
      <dd>
	The DateTime class provides many methods for managing and converting
	date/time values. A time_t value is used inside the class for
	storage.
	<p>
      <dt>Directory
      <dd>
	This is a collection of file statistics for files on the disk
	that match a given pattern (i.e. a directory listing).

	<p>
      <dt>FileBatch
      <dd>
	This class gives collection type access (i.e. begin() & end() methods)
	to a file that contains fixed size records.
	
	<p>
      <dt>FilePath
      <dd>
	This class is a Str (See Str.hh) that also contains methods specific
	to manipulating file names, directory names and file extentions.

	<p>
      <dt>FileStat
      <dd>
	FileStat is provides information about files and modification
	of file permisions. It is basically just a wrapper around
	the stat and chmod calls.

	<p>
      <dt>Log
      <dd>
	  Log is a specialized ostream. It provides control over
	how and where the data placed in the log will be output.
	<p>
	  There are two types of control, Levels and Filters.
	<p>
	  Levels are used to indicate the type of log entry,
	  (i.e. Debug, Error, Warning) that is placed in the log.
	<p>
	  Filters provide for control over the content of the entry.
	<p>
	  An application can specify what type of entries it
	  wants output (i.e. Error | Warning ). It can then
	  create any number of log entries and specify the level
	  for each one. Only those entries specified for output
	  will actually be written to the log.
	<p>
	  Filters can be used to write log entries with a specific
	  level and content to any 'streambuf' destination.
	<p>
      <dt>LogBuf
      <dd>
	This is a specialized streambuf used by Log to
	output log messages.

	<p>
      <dt>LogLevel
      <dd>
	A LogLevel should be used in conjuntion with a Log and LogBuf.
	The LogBuf contains a LogLevel to determine which log messages
	it should output.
	<p>
	  The LogLevel has two states. The first is the 'output'. It is a
	  mask of all levels that should be output. The second is 'current',
	  which is the level for the current log message.
	<p>
      <dt>LruMap
      <dd>
	LruMap provides a Least Recently Used algorithm to access a
	collection of objects based on a specific key value.

	<p>
      <dt>LruSash
      <dd>
	LruSash provides a Least Recently Used algorithm to access a
	collection of objects based on a specific key value. This
	implementation uses a simple hash for indexing.

	<p>
      <dt>Param
      <dd>
	This is the base class for providing command line argument parsing.
	It lets you identify arguemntes and/or environment varaibles
	to be parsed and converted in to program variables. It
	also create a help message that documentes the
	arguments and environment varaibles.
	<p>
	  There are a number of flags and enviroment varaibles already
	  defined for control of the log and help. They are described below.
	<p>
	  It also contains a Log that can be used by the application.
	<p>  
	  The most effective way to utilize this class is to create
	  a subclass called 'AppParam' and customize it for your
	  application (see Example: at end of file).
	
	<p>
      <dt>RegexScan
      <dd>
	Regular expresion pattern matcher. This is a wrapper
	around Gnu's regex 'c' functions. The following description
	is specific to the default syntax of RE_SYNTAX_EGREP (see 
	'setDefaultSyntax' below).
	
	<p>
      <dt>SizeIt
      <dd>
	This class provides an object that can be used to manage the size of
	something. The sizing value is maintained as a factor of 2. This
	reduces the chance that the sizing value will be increased as the
	object using it continues to grow.

	<p>
      <dt>Str
      <dd>
	A 'Str' provides many methods to manipulate sequences
  	of characters. It is a 'iostream' so you can use the '&lt;&lt;'
  	and '&gt;&gt;' operators.

	<p>
      <dt>SubStr
      <dd>
	A 'SubStr' is a section of a 'Str'. Any modifications to
  	the 'SubStr' modify the 'Str' it is a section of.

	<p>
      <dt>Timer
      <dd>
	This is a simple realtime timer class.
	<p>

    </dl>
    <h3>Unix Specific Classes</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>FileLock
      <dd>
	This class provides access to Unix's volintary file locking
	mechinisms.
	
	<p>
      <dt>FileOp
      <dd>
	FileOp provides operations on entire files, such as copy and
	move (rename).

	<p>
      <dt>HotSwap
      <dd>
	HotSwap is a means to change the files an application is using
	while it continues to execute.

	<p>
      <dt>InboundProcessor
      <dd>
	The InboundProcessor watches an inbound directory for file
	names that match a specified pattern. When a matching file
	name is found, it is moved to the processing directory and
	the Proc::operator () ( const FilePath & fn ) method is 
	called for the file.
	
	<p>
      <dt>MesgQueue
      <dd>
	This class provides an interface to the Unix Message Queue IPC
	facility.
	<p>
      <dt>PidFile
      <dd>
	This class will create a file that contains the Process Id (pid)
	of the process that instanciated it. When the PidFile object is
	destroyied the file is removed.

	<p>
      <dt>Semaphore
      <dd>
	 This class provides an interface to the Unix Semaphore IPC facility.
	<p>
      <dt>SigCatcher
      <dd>
	 Catch signals so they can be iterpreted by the application.
	<p>
      <dt>TimeIt
      <dd>
	This class provides detailed resource utilization information between
	it's start() and stop() methods. This most usefull during performance
	tuning of an application.

	<p>
      <dt>User
      <dd>
	 A User provide logon information about a user on a Unix system.
	<p>
      <dt>UserGroup
      <dd>
	 A UserGroup provides information about a Unix group on the system.
